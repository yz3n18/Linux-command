Get started

Make a directory called “ANSWER” in your home directory, put any files you collect along the way here.

CLUE1: There is a file that is not shown on the Treasure map, find it and open it to find the second clue.
project4/datafiles/chrYUCSCgenes.txt

#CLUE2:Copy the file called chrXUCSCgenes.txt in this directory, to your answer directory and save as "answer1".
Now go up one directory. You are tired, find a place to rest.
cp chrXUCSCgenes.txt /home/jg/BIOL6055/SESSION1/TREASUREHUNT/ANSWER/answer1
go to project4/chr22UCSCgenes.bed


#CLUE3:Copy the last 4 lines of this file to a file called "answer2" and move it to your answer directory. Now find the
longest file in this directory.
tail -n 4 *bed > /home/jg/BIOL6055/SESSION1/TREASUREHUNT/ANSWER/answer2
longest file = chr19UCSCgenes.txt
$ wc chr* | sort -r

#CLUE4: Go to the project1 directory. Which file is has most recently modified?
ls –lht
Most recent at top and time shown =chr20microsat.txt


#CLUE5: Find the deepest file (one furthest from home)
Deepest= project2/jan2014/dataset2/1000gphase1.txt
$ tree

#CLUE6: Some files are very slow, this one is much quicker!
Fasta file = project3/results/chr22gencodegenes.fasta


CLUE7: Go to the datafiles directory in project2. Copy the file chr21dbsnp138.txt to your answer directory and call it
"answer3". How many occurences of rs143503259 are there in the file chr22dbsnp138.txt? go to the line
corresponding to that number. (i.e. if 20, go to line 20 in chr22dbsnp138.txt)
cp chr21dbsnp138.txt /home/jg/BIOL6055/SESSION1/TREASUREHUNT/ANSWER/answer3
grep rs143503259 chr22dbsnp138.txt | wc –l
=11


CLUE8: Extract rows 81-100 from chr20dbSNP138.txt, then extract "CLUE9" (just CLUE9 !)
head -100 chr20dbsnp138.txt | tail -20 | grep -w CLUE9


CLUE9: Go to the project3 datafiles directory and find out how long the longest line is in chr22gencodegenes.txt. Go
to the file that has that many lines.
wc -L chr22gencodegenes.txt


CLUE10: Change the word "Atlantic" to the word "Caribbean" wherever it appears in this directory. Copy the file
chr19gencodegenes.txt to your answer directory. Then go to your answer directory. Concatenate all the files in the
folder and remove lines containing "Q" and "#". Save the file as answers_all and change the permissions to
executable. Now run the file.
BIOL3063/6074 & 6055
3 of 3
sed -i 's/Atlantic/Caribbean/' *
cp chr19gencodegenes.txt /home/jg/BIOL6055/SESSION1/TREASUREHUNT/ANSWER/answer4
cat * | egrep -v "Q|#" > answers_all
chmod +x answers_all
./answers_all
